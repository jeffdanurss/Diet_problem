# Nutritional Cost Analysis Dashboard 🍽️📊

This project visualizes the daily cost distribution for different dietary profiles using Python and popular data visualization libraries. It calculates and graphs the unit cost per person, total cost distribution, and the relationship between number of people and total cost.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The dashboard presents a clear view of the nutritional cost problem with three distinct profiles:
- Sick Person (`Persona Enferma`)
- Young Adult (`Adulto Joven`)
- Lactose Intolerant (`Intolerante`)

It uses **Matplotlib** to generate:
1. A bar chart showing unit costs per profile.
2. A pie chart displaying the percentage distribution of total costs.
3. A line chart illustrating how total cost increases with the number of people.
